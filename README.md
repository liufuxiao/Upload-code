```javascript
// Programmatic key, available in luis.ai under Account Settings
const LUIS_programmaticKey = "67fa05fd36ca4d4cbc8c2eb91e41dc10";
// ID of your LUIS app to which you want to add an utterance
const LUIS_appId = "6a18e3d5-7267-4b94-b1c4-8944b866fbc8";
```
 
 
# 2. Format of the submitting utterance

Submit the utterance as JSON. You have to write it carefully or JSON.parse() will send a err.

The JSON format of luis and dialogflow has been unified.
