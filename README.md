##The way of executing:
The only file you need to execute is 'upload.js'. You are allowed to choose the destination of google or Microsoft
which you upload to. But remember to update the 'account ID' and the 'app ID' in 'add-utterances1.js' and 'add-utterances2.js'. 
Besides, the 'sample.txt' and 'utterance.json' are the data files.When 'upload.js' is working on, it will invoke the command 
line to execuate "add-utterances1.js" and "add-uttterances2.js" relatively according to your choice.

intents in "utterance.json" have been created. If you want create the new app or the new intent, it's ok but you have to change
