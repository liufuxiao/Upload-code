# 2. Format of the submitting utterance

Submit the utterance as JSON. You have to write it carefully or JSON.parse() will send a err.

The JSON format of Google and Microsoft has been unified.


### A example:

```
{
        "displayName": "TurnOn",
        "trainingPhrases": [
            {
                "type": "TYPE_EXAMPLE",
                "parts": [
                    {
                        "text": "Please turn "
                    },
                    {
                        "text": "on",
                        "entityType": "@Operation"
                    },
